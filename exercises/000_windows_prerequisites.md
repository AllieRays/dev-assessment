### Docker Settings 
once docker is downloaded start docker desktop \
then from the toolbar icon right click settings \
Click on "Switch to Linux Containers" \
Then Click on settings \
() change the following settings \
... () start docker deskop when you log in \
... () expose daemon ton tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS \
..... () Navigate to Resources -> File Sharing \
..... () Check C drive \
..... () Apply and Restart Docker 


## Windows Dependency Package Manager Chocolatey
Copy the following text and paste it into powershell
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')) 
```
() Wait a few seconds for the command to complete. \
() If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey! Type  `choco`  or  `choco -?`  now, or see  [Getting Started](https://chocolatey.org/docs/getting-started)  for usage instructions.


## PHP 7.3
`choco install php --version=7.3.0` \
update your php.ini file located at `C:\tools\php73\php.ini` \
update your memory_limit to `256M` \
remove `;`to uncomment `extension=gd2` 

## Composer 
Install composer globally \
`choco install composer`

## WSL 
Download [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) \
You must create a UNIX username with a password when prompted at the end of the installation process. Certain Acquia BLT  commands will not function if you install the Windows Subsystem for Linux using an account without a password.

To install the required applications for Acquia BLT (including PHP, Node.js, Git, and Composer), run the following commands:
Run the following command, and press Enter when prompted:
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php`

Run the following command:
`sudo apt-get update`

Run the following command, based on your installed version of Acquia BLT:
`sudo apt-get install -y php7.3 php7.3-cli php7.3-curl php7.3-xml php7.3-mbstring php7.3-bz2 php7.3-gd php7.3-mysql mysql-client unzip git`

Run the following command:\
`php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"`

Run the following command:\
`php composer-setup.php`

Run the following command:\
`sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`

Run the following command:\
`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -`

Run the following command:\
`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Install Python 3 and PIP.
`sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip`

Install Docker Compose into your user's home directory.
`pip3 install --user docker-compose`


### Ensure Volume Mounts Work
WSL, windows and docker do not play nice together with file path sharing. We need to fix that. Create a wsl.conf file
`sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf`
```
[automount]
root = /
options = "metadata"
```
save and close 


() Configuring Git \

Before working with an Acquia BLT project, you must identify yourself to Git by running the following commands:\
`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`\
`git config --global user.name "Your Name"` \
If you havenâ€™t already configured an SSH identity (useful for working with projects on GitHub and interacting with your websites on Acquia Cloud), you should generate an SSH key.

() Add function to .bashrc file 
inside the Windows Subsystem \
`nano  ~\.bashrc`\
add this function
```
function blt() {
  if [ "'git rev-parse --show-cdup 2> /dev/null'" != "" ]; then
    GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)
  else
    GIT_ROOT="."
  fi

  if [ -f "$GIT_ROOT/vendor/bin/blt" ]; then
    $GIT_ROOT/vendor/bin/blt "$@"
  else
    echo "You must run this command from within a BLT-generated project repository."
  fi
}
```
source ~/.bashrc


## Restart your computer
() Save and close and restart your computer. \
() Once the windows machine is up and running restart docker and check the settings listed above \
Everything else will be done again with Unbuntu
